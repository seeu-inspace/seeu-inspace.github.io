						<h3>Do you need a Penetration Test?</h3>

							Do you need to improve the security of your application with a Penetration Test? My methodology in providing security assessment services is in line with <a href="https://owasp.org/" target=_blank>OWASP</a> standards and my experience is from years of training and passion. If you have a Web, Mobile or Desktop Application and you need a penetration test, let me know!

							I love finding new vulnerabilities and I'm always looking for new experience with more realities. Do you have a cool team of hackers, but need an extra hand? Do you have a private bug bounty program and are you looking for a hacker to find vulnerabilities in your applications? Let me have more details and let's see if we can work together!

						<h3>Do you have a web3 project?</h3>
						<p>
							From 2019 I started to get closer to the world of blockchains. For months, <a href="https://github.com/seeu-inspace/reference-web3-security" target=_blank>I've studied it from a hacker's point of view</a> to give my contribution to the safety of web3.
							At the moment I'm searching for projects to test for free what I've learned. If you have an interesting enough web3 project and a smart contract  that you need to test, let me know!
